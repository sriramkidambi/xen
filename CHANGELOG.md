### Changed

### Improved

- Show clean message while GUI editor is open

## [0.2.3] - 2026-01-03

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Profile switching now provides full isolation
- Profiles are completely independent - switching profiles replaces ALL files in live config
- Current state is automatically saved to the old profile before switching (no data loss)

### Fixed

- Profile creation now sets the profile as active (enables proper save-before-switch)
- All files and directories (including hidden/dotfiles) are captured in profiles

### Migration

Users upgrading from 0.2.2 should be aware that runtime state (todos, transcripts, etc.) 
will now be profile-specific rather than shared across profiles.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: Profile switch no longer deletes unmanaged files (data loss bug affecting all harnesses)
- Profile creation/save now captures arbitrary directories, not just files
- Deep merge for managed directories preserves unknown nested files

### Security

- Fixed data loss vulnerability in profile switching (reported by @melvynxdev)

## [0.2.1] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed

- OpenCode skill installation now properly sanitizes skill names (e.g., "Hook Development" → "hook-development")

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added

- **Installation System**: Complete `install` command with interactive skill selection from GitHub repos
- Skill discovery module wrapping `skills-locate`
- Skill installation executor with path safety validation
- Agent and command discovery and installation
- MCP server discovery from GitHub repos
- Manifest tracking for installed components
- `uninstall` command for skills, agents, and commands
- `GroupMultiSelect` UI for profile selection
- Improved install UI and discovery for claude-code format
- Show disabled/warning states for incompatible agents
- Discord release notification workflow

### Fixed

- Use canonical dirs for profile storage, add harness writes for agents/commands
- Use canonical resource directory names in profile extraction
- Use harness-aware paths for profile resource sync
- Copy all subdirectories when creating profile from current
- TUI profile creation now copies all resources
- Check harness capability before installing agents/commands
- Transform skill names for OpenCode compatibility
- TUI: show skills/agents/commands for inactive profiles
- Replace path deps with published crates
- Update dialoguer imports to `dialoguer_multiselect`

### Documentation
